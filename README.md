# 🧠 EEG Athlete Project: Cognitive Monitoring During Golf Swings

This project explores the relationship between EEG brain activity and golf swing performance. We analyze EEG frequency band power (Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) to identify cognitive patterns linked to athlete-rated swing quality.

## 📁 Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `figures/`: Generated plots and EEG topomaps
- `data/`: (Optional) EEG data (can be a placeholder or simulated)
- `README.md`: You are here!

## 🔧 Tools Used

- MNE-Python
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy.stats (correlation, bootstrapping)
- Git & GitHub for collaboration

## 📊 Key Results

- Positive correlation between alpha power and swing score (r = 0.43)
- EEG topomaps reveal parietal alpha activation linked to better shots
